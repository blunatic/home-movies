Built using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/
) the [Internet Archive API](https://archive.org/help/json.php) and [Jamendo API](https://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0). The wonderful animation framework [GSAP](greensock.com/gsap) was also used to assist with some of the animations.
